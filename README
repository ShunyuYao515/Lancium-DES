LANCIUM Discrete Event Simulation Project
 
  1. The tool we are using is Ptolemy II developed by UC Berkeley, to download it, Click the "Unix Line Endings" at:
 
    https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII11.0/index.htm
    
  2. To execute the model:
    a). Put the model xml file together with the input file in the same proprietary directory
    b). set $PTII to Ptolemy installation path.
    c). Make sure to compile all the customized actor files (see 3.).
    d). run:
      
       ${PTII}/bin/vergil path/to/your/model.xml

  3. For customized actor files, move them to their corresponding directories and run the make file in those directories to compile them:
     Synchronizer2.java:    ${PTII}/ptolemy/actor/lib/

  4. Subcluster Parameterization Update
     Currently an intermediate representation of configuration is given to temporarily take the place of JSON configurations.
     a). Put a "configT" file (See configT example) under the same directory with model_gen.sh.
     b). Run:
      
         ./model_gen.xml
         
     c). You'll see the generated model as Lancium_model.xml.
